{"prompt": "Claim: Vitamin D appears increase COVID-19 mortality rates \nEvidence: A principal defence against uncontrolled inflammation, and against viral infection in general, is provided by T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs). Treg levels have been reported to be low in many COVID-19 patients and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to occur more frequently in patients with obesity and diabetes. These conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19.

{"prompt": "Claim: coronavirus may originated in a lab\nEvidence: Covid19 infection began in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December, 2019.\nAnswer:", "completion": " NOT ENOUGH INFO"}
{"prompt": "Claim: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Advil and Motrin can make COVID-19 symptoms worse.\nEvidence: CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of COVID-19 patients, ibuprofen use was not associated with worse clinical outcomes, compared with paracetamol or no antipyretic.\nAnswer:", "completion": " REFUTED"}
{"prompt": "Claim: Animals don't appear to play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.\nEvidence: On April 22, CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported cases of two domestic cats with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nAnswer:", "completion": " NOT ENOUGH INFO"}
{"prompt": "Claim: SARS-CoV-2 is more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard\nEvidence: The risk of transmission via touching contaminated paper is low.\nAnswer:", "completion": " NOT ENOUGH INFO"}
{"prompt": "Claim: The pandemic coronavirus will wane with warmer weather, like some other respiratory\nEvidence: Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the number of confirmed cases.\nAnswer:", "completion": " REFUTED"}
{"prompt": "Claim: social distancing is the most effective measure of containing the spread of the new coronavirus.\nEvidence: counties where the policies have been imposed have effectively increased social distancing and have seen slowing the spread of COVID-19.\nAnswer:", "completion": " SUPPORTED"}
{"prompt": "Claim: Long-term health conditions and aging weaken your immune system\nEvidence: The CD4 + memory exploiting could help immune system to recall immunity of already know antigens against coronaviruses, avoiding or limiting \"lung crash\" until virus specific immunity develops and making it faster and prolonged. Finally, this administration could be helpful not only in already infected patients, but also before infection. In fact, people could have an immune system more ready when the contact with the Covid-19 will occur.\nAnswer:", "completion": " NOT ENOUGH INFO"}
{"prompt": "Claim: Is it safe to take acetaminophen/Tylenol to treat coronavirus symptoms? yes it is.\nEvidence: There are clearly COVID-19 cases where NSAIDs should not be used, but there is no strong evidence that NSAIDs must be avoided in all patients with COVID-19\nAnswer:", "completion": " SUPPORTED"}
{"prompt": "Claim: Yes, kids can get COVID-19\nEvidence: We conducted a retrospective analysis of children with suspected COVID-19 at a Specialist Childrens Hospital to determine outcomes based on COVID-19 testing status and underlying health vulnerabilities.\nAnswer:", "completion": " SUPPORTED"}
{"prompt": "Claim: Early symptoms for covid-19: include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. These appear as soon as 2 days, or as long as 14 days, after exposure to the virus.\nEvidence: Distinguishing pre-existing and de novo antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for serology, seroprevalence and vaccine studies, as well as for our understanding of susceptibility to and natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nAnswer:", "completion": " NOT ENOUGH INFO"}
