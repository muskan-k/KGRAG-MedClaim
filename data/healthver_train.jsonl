{"prompt": "Evidence:\n1. Aspirin is an NSAID commonly used to reduce fever.\n2. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, which lowers body temperature.\n\nClaim: Aspirin reduces fever.\nQuestion: Based on the above, is this claim SUPPORTED, CONTRADICTED, or UNCERTAIN?", "response": "SUPPORTED: Aspirin effectively reduces fever by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, a key mediator in fever response."}
{"prompt": "Evidence:\n1. Ibuprofen is often prescribed for fever reduction.\n2. Both aspirin and ibuprofen work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes.\n\nClaim: Aspirin is less effective than ibuprofen at reducing fever.\nQuestion: Based on the above, is this claim SUPPORTED, CONTRADICTED, or UNCERTAIN?", "response": "UNCERTAIN: While both drugs inhibit COX enzymes, direct comparative studies are needed to conclude relative effectiveness."}
{"prompt": "Evidence:\n1. Acetaminophen reduces fever via central action in the brain.\n2. It does not have significant anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nClaim: Acetaminophen causes anti-inflammatory effects.\nQuestion: Based on the above, is this claim SUPPORTED, CONTRADICTED, or UNCERTAIN?", "response": "CONTRADICTED: Acetaminophen primarily acts centrally without significant peripheral anti-inflammatory activity."}
