# KGRAG-MedClaim: A Graph-RAG Approach for Medical Misinformation Detection

This project implements a Graph-RAG pipeline to verify biomedical claims using both structured (knowledge graph) and unstructured (PubMed abstracts) evidence, paired with reasoning-enhanced large language models. Built on top of the [HealthVer](https://github.com/sarrouti/HealthVer) dataset.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Extracts âŸ¨subject, predicate, objectâŸ© triples from HealthVer evidence using LLM-based prompts, stored in a Neo4j database.
- **PubMed Retrieval**: Uses SciSpaCy + MeSH expansion + BM25 ranking to fetch relevant abstracts from PubMed.
- **RAG + CoT Reasoning**: Fuses KG triples and abstracts in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation setup, with instruction fine-tuned Mistral-7B and hidden scratchpad reasoning.
- **Structured Outputs**: Returns JSON-formatted verdicts (`SUPPORTS`, `REFUTES`, `NOT_ENOUGH_INFO`) with rationales.
